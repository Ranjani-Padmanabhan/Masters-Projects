## Data Science Projects

The following projects were done by me as part of my Masters (MSc) in Data Science education.
Projects were done in Python and R.

### Machine Learning / Python

* **Condition-Based Predective Maintenance for Trucks Using Machine Learning** - The objective of this research was to build a Multi Label Classification model using Python to predict the health status of heavy vehicles based on the performance of its components. 
* **Rail Ticket Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms** - Built a machine learning model to predict the demand and prices of train tickets using different Regression models in Python.

### R

* **HOUSING PREDICTION USING MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION** - Built a model using R to predict the housing prices using Multiple Linear Regression based on a number of independent factors.
* **Interactive dashboard to display flight statistics** - Developed a dashboard to visually represent flight information (Arrival /Departure delays and cancellations) using Flexdashboard and Shiny packages in R.

### Big Data Technology / Apache Spark

* **Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate the capabilities of Spark** - Implemented Spark using different file formats of data such as AVRO, PARQUET, CSV, Text file and HIVE to analyse its functionality  and understand its strength and limitations. Used Scala as the programming language.
